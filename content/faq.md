Hello and welcome to the FAQ. Please read this first and see if it answers your question. If not, consider [contacting]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) us.

## 1. How do I join the server?

There are two ways for you to join the server:

- Open the server list and choose "*Modded*". Search for "*ProtonRust*" and our server should appear there. Click on the name and choose "*Connect*". **THIS WONT WORK IF YOU HAVE A GAMEBAN**
- Press `F1` and type `connect play.protonrust.com:25566` and press enter.

## 2. I can't attack any players on the server / My name is marked with *TAR*

This means that out anti cheat system, *ProtonAntiCheat*, doesn't trust you enough.
Every player on ProtonRust has a unique PAC score, similar to your VAC score. This score determines what you can and cant do on our servers. If this value is low you wont be able to PvP other players, and if it falls further you wont be able join the server at all. This won't you haven't been banned before but if you have an EAC or similar might not work.

What can I do to improve my PAC score?
- Set your profile to public, including your friend list and what games you have. This information helps us to determine if you are related to other known cheaters and how much your steam account is worth (cheats are less likely to spend money on steam).
- Play more Rust! It doesn't necessarily have to be on our server, but having more hours helps us verify that you are not cheating.
